\begin{abstract}
 Governmental case management processes are tightly governed by law but also contains parts that may depend on local conditions or be discretionary in nature. We describe how the declarative Dynamic Condition Response graph process notation can be used to capture both kinds of actions and provide methods for describing processes and validating process descriptions. As a first case study we consider a few paragraphs in the Danish Consolidation Act on Social Services governing the rights of compensation for loss of earnings for parents of children with long-term illness or disabilities.

\section{Introduction}
Governmental case work is by nature tightly governed by paragraphs in laws. Still, a case management process will most often consist of a mixture of actions prescribed by law and actions carried out for other reasons and which are governed by other more or less formalised rules.
